**🎮 How It Works?**

1. Sudoku Board Setup
The 9x9 grid is generated dynamically using JavaScript.
Users can click on a cell and enter numbers manually.
2. Game Logic & Validation
The game checks row, column, and 3x3 grid constraints to ensure a valid move.
Invalid moves are highlighted in red.
3. Auto-Solver with Backtracking
Clicking the Solve button triggers the backtracking algorithm.
The algorithm fills in the correct numbers by recursively checking valid placements.
